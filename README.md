# motion-detection-alarm-system
This is a project created to demonstrate my approach to create a motion detection system capable of :

-Beginning by the push of a button
-detecting a start motion and end motion
-taking a picture at each motion detection using the webcam with "fswebcam" which allows us to tell the command line to take a photo using the os command within python
-activate a .wav file upon motion detection
-creata a csv file to store and append start annd end motion timestamps
-Sounding a buzzer when motion is detected
-Formatting each image taken with a timestamp as to avoid confusion

Equipment used:
-webcam
-PIR sensor
-Buzzer
-Button
-Breadboard
-GPIO Extension Board
